# Telegram Bot

A GTP-2 1.5b chatbot for Telegram with persistent sessions.

his project was made to test the GTP-2 1.5b model using Google Colaboratory and Telegram APIs.
It works like a chatbot by tricking the model into completing a conversation and parsing the output.
GTP2 1.5B replies could be made more accurate by fine-tuning the model using chats as a dataset;
however, due to the GPU limitations of Google Colab and my lack of machine learning hardware I was not able to do so myself.
